# Voice-Based Healthcare Q&A Application

## Abstract
A voice-based search and Q&A system for disseminating reliable healthcare information in Indian languages, leveraging Sarvam-M through advanced prompt engineering for accuracy and safety.

## Overview
This project, developed for DA 225o Deep Learning (Summer 2025), aims to provide accessible healthcare information to diverse Indian users through a voice interface, ensuring cultural relevance and safety.

## Project Motivation
Addresses the gap in reliable, language-accessible healthcare information in India, improving health literacy and awareness.
Key challenges in the Indian healthcare landscape include a skewed doctor-patient ratio, limited access to qualified medical advice in remote and rural areas, and significant linguistic diversity. This project specifically aims to mitigate these by:
*   Providing initial healthcare information and guidance in multiple Indian languages, reducing language as a barrier.
*   Offering a first point of contact for common health queries, potentially reducing the load on overwhelmed healthcare professionals for non-critical issues.
*   Improving health literacy by making information more understandable and accessible, particularly for users who might rely more on oral communication or have difficulty with text-based resources.

## Key Features
- Multi-language voice input/output (10 Indian languages).
- AI-driven responses for general healthcare questions via prompt-engineered Sarvam-M.
- Safety guardrails with disclaimers and emergency redirection.
- Interactive Symptom Checker with Preliminary Triage Advice.

## Technologies Used
- **Sarvam AI Platform**: Utilized for its comprehensive suite of AI services for Indian languages, including:
    - **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: For converting user's voice input in various Indian languages into text. (Leveraging Sarvam AI's Saarika v2 STT or similar models).
    - **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: For synthesizing voice output from the generated text responses in a natural-sounding Indian voice.
    - **Large Language Model (Sarvam-M)**: For Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to interpret user queries, and for generating responses through sophisticated prompt engineering techniques. Sarvam-M's capabilities in handling Indian languages and generating contextually relevant, conversational text are key to the application's core logic, including symptom assessment summaries and general health information.

## System Architecture Overview

The application integrates several key components to deliver a voice-based healthcare Q&A experience:

1.  **Voice Interface (STT/TTS)**: User interacts via voice. Sarvam AI services handle speech-to-text conversion of the user's query and text-to-speech for delivering the system's response.
2.  **NLU Processor (`nlu_processor.py`)**: The transcribed text query is processed by Sarvam-M to identify the user's intent (e.g., asking about a disease, describing symptoms) and extract relevant medical entities (symptoms, diseases, etc.).
3.  **Core Logic Orchestration (`main.py`)**: This script orchestrates the overall flow. Based on the NLU output, it decides whether to invoke the Symptom Checker or the standard prompt-based Q&A flow.
4.  **Symptom Checker (`symptom_checker.py`)**:
    *   If activated, this module manages an interactive dialogue to gather more details about the user's symptoms using predefined questions from `symptom_knowledge_base.json`.
    *   It then compiles this information and uses Sarvam-M to generate a preliminary assessment, which is further augmented by rule-based triage points from the local knowledge base.
5.  **Response Generation (Standard Queries - `response_generator.py`)**:
    *   For non-symptom related health queries, `response_generator.py` constructs a detailed prompt using the user's query and NLU output.
    *   This prompt is then sent to Sarvam-M, which generates an informed answer based on its general knowledge and the guidance provided in the system prompt (see `src/prompts.py`). This process relies on effective prompt engineering rather than external knowledge base retrieval for general queries.
6.  **Safety Layer**: All generated responses (from Symptom Checker or standard query responses) pass through a safety layer. This includes hardcoded checks for emergencies or diagnosis requests and ensures appropriate disclaimers are appended.
7.  **Knowledge Bases**:
    *   `symptom_knowledge_base.json`: A structured JSON file defining symptoms, keywords, follow-up questions, and basic triage points for the Symptom Checker.

## Symptom Checker and Triage

The application includes an interactive symptom checker to help users understand potential implications of their symptoms and receive general guidance.

**How it works:**
1.  **Activation**: If the NLU module identifies a user's query as relating to symptoms (e.g., "I have a fever and a cough"), the Symptom Checker is activated.
2.  **Interactive Q&A**: The checker may ask a series of follow-up questions based on the initially reported symptoms. These questions are drawn from the `symptom_knowledge_base.json` file. This step is interactive, requiring further voice input from the user for each question.
3.  **Preliminary Assessment**: Once sufficient information is gathered, the Symptom Checker generates a preliminary assessment. This involves:
    *   Sending the collected symptom details (initial query + answers to follow-ups) to the Sarvam-M model for a summarized interpretation and suggested next steps.
    *   Augmenting this with relevant `basic_triage_points` from the `symptom_knowledge_base.json`.
4.  **Output**: The user receives this assessment, which includes a summary, suggested severity, recommended general next steps, potential warnings, and relevant triage points from the knowledge base.

**Important Disclaimer**: The information provided by the symptom checker is for general guidance only and is **not a medical diagnosis**. Users are always advised to consult a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to their health. This disclaimer is consistently provided with any assessment.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
*   Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
*   Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>` 
*   Navigate to the project directory: `cd <repository-name>` 
*   Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
*   Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
*   Create a `.env` file in the project root. You can copy from `.env.example` if provided, or create it manually. Add your Sarvam API key:
    ```env
    SARVAM_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
    ```
    *(Obtainable from the Sarvam AI dashboard).*

### Running the Application (Streamlit UI)
The primary way to interact with the application is through the Streamlit UI.
```bash
streamlit run src/ui.py
```
Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` (or the URL provided by Streamlit).

### CLI Mode (Core Logic Testing)
The `main.py` script offers a command-line interface, mainly for testing the core backend logic. It uses a mock STT by default and has limited interactivity compared to the Streamlit UI.
```bash
python main.py
```

### Important Notes for Voice Input:

*   **Microphone Permissions**: Users will need to grant microphone permissions to their browser for the voice input feature to work.
*   **HTTPS Required**: For browsers to allow microphone access, the application must be served over HTTPS. Streamlit Community Cloud provides this by default. If you are self-hosting in a way that results in an HTTP URL, voice input might not work on many browsers. Localhost is often an exception.

## Limitations

While this application aims to provide useful healthcare information, it has several limitations:

*   **Not a Diagnostic Tool**: The system, including the Symptom Checker, cannot provide medical diagnoses or replace consultation with qualified healthcare professionals. It offers general guidance only.
*   **Accuracy of STT/NLU**: The quality of the interaction heavily depends on the accuracy of the Speech-to-Text and Natural Language Understanding components, especially with diverse accents and complex queries.
*   **Knowledge Base Scope**: The effectiveness of responses for general queries depends on the LLM's training data, as RAG from an external medical KB is not used for these. The Symptom Checker relies on `symptom_knowledge_base.json`, which currently covers a limited set of common symptoms.
*   **LLM Hallucinations/Errors**: While prompt engineering aims to guide the LLM, there's always a possibility of generating incorrect or irrelevant information, especially for queries not covered by the symptom checker's specific logic. Safety layers and disclaimers are crucial.
*   **Complex Symptom Combinations**: The current Symptom Checker logic and LLM prompting for assessment are designed for common symptom presentations. Highly complex, rare, or subtly combined symptoms might not be interpreted adequately.
*   **No User Memory**: The system currently does not maintain user history or context across different sessions.

## Future Work

Several enhancements could further improve the application:

*   **Expanded Knowledge Bases**: Continuously update and expand `symptom_knowledge_base.json` with more symptoms, details, and languages/dialects. For general queries, explore re-introducing a refined RAG system if specific, curated knowledge is deemed necessary beyond the LLM's general capabilities.
*   **User Profiles and Personalization**: Allow users to create profiles to store preferences (language, etc.) and optionally, a secure health history for more personalized advice (with strong privacy safeguards).
*   **Integration with External Services**: Explore possibilities for integrating with services like appointment booking, medication reminders, or telemedicine platforms, with user consent.
*   **Enhanced NLU for Mixed Languages**: Improve handling of queries that mix English with Indian languages (Hinglish, Tanglish, etc.).
*   **UI/UX Improvements**: Enhance the Streamlit UI (if used) or develop a more robust mobile interface for wider accessibility.
*   **Refined Prompt Engineering**: Continuously refine system prompts for both general queries and the symptom checker to improve accuracy, tone, and safety of responses.
*   **Multi-turn Symptom Checking**: Develop a more dynamic multi-turn conversational ability for the symptom checker beyond the current scripted follow-up questions.
